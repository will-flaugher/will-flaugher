## 👋 About Me

I never expected my journey to take me from performing in concert halls across the world to designing systems and solving complex business problems across global operations. But looking at the overlap between my musical background and my corporate success, it makes perfect sense. Musicians 𝘀𝘆𝗻𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅 𝗶𝗻𝗽𝘂𝘁𝘀, 𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗼𝘄𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 – these same traits now shape my approach to strategic operations and product leadership.

I’m a data-minded strategist who thrives at the intersection of operations, product management, and technology. My experience spans AI implementation, platform deployments, service design, and building data frameworks that illuminate and drive measurable business outcomes. I bring 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗵𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗮𝘀𝗺 to every project, helping make the complex work of transformation more effective and more enjoyable.

With my MBA-backed foundation in business strategy and a musician’s eye for detail, I excel at identifying inefficiencies, translating stakeholder needs into practical solutions, and building scalable systems to support business growth.
